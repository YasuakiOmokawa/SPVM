# SPVM - Fast calculation, GC, static typing, VM with perlish syntax

Do you need **faster Perl**? SPVM provides fast calculation to Perl.

- **Fast calculation** - The Perl's biggest weak point is the calculation performance. SPVM provides fast calculations.
- **GC** - You don't need to care about freeing memory
- **Static typing** - Static typing for performance
- **VM** - Byte codes are generated so that you can run them on SPVM language
- **Perlish syntax** - SPVM syntax is very similar to Perl
- **Perl module** - SPVM function can be called from Perl itself (Not yet implemented).

This is now under **developing**.

See [SPVM](https://metacpan.org/pod/SPVM) on CPAN if you need document.
