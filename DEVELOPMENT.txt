  EXE TESTS
    
    SPVM can create exe file.
    
      perl Makefile.PL
      make && perl -Mblib -- blib/script/spvmcc -I t/default/lib TestCase::MyExe
      env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=spvm_build/work/exe spvm_build/work/exe/TestCase__MyExe
 
      gdb spvm_build/work/exe/MyExe core.*
    
    Debug mode
    
      perl Makefile.PL --OPTIMIZE="-O0 -g" --DEFINE=SPVM_DEBUG_DUMP && \
      make && perl -Mblib -- blib/script/spvmcc -I t/default/lib -B spvm_build/work/exe -n MyExe TestCase::MyExe && \
      gcc -o spvm_build/work/exe/MyExe spvm_build/work/exe/libmy_main.so && \
      spvm_build/work/exe/MyExe
  
  EXTERNAL LIBRARY
    
    For unicode processing, utf8proc is used. SPVM utf8proc is replaced utf8proc to spvm_utf8proc, UTF8PROC to SPVM_UTF8PROC

  PORTABILITY NOTE
  
    Compiler type, version and working is various in different environments. 
    Main compiler targets is gcc and clang.
    Main OS targets is Linux/Unix, Windows, macOS.
    To keep maxmam portability, I have the following rule.
  
    - don't use realloc.
    - don't use global variables
    - don't use inline keyword
    - use -std=c99 always in core modules
    - use fgetc instead of getc for FreeBSD compile error
    - Don't use os error number(error.h defined values) outside of native subrsoutine.
    - Don't contain os dependency features(for example unistd.h, windows.h)
    - NOTE: In Windows/MinGW/Strawbery Perl, newline is always \x0A if mode is text mode
    - Automatically loaded module must not be native or precompile
      Currently, SPVM::Byte, SPVM::Short, SPVM::Int, SPVM::Long, SPVM::Float, SPVM::Double, SPVM::Complex_2f, SPVM::Complex_2d

  CODING GUIDE LINE
    - use int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t instead of byte, short, int, long, _Bool.
    - char is used for only character.
    - char[] is used for only string.
    - constant value is defined by enum { } syntax.
    - constant name is ,for example, SPVM_TYPE_C_FLAG_REF.
      all character is upper case or under score. need _C_ between package name and constant base name
    - fix all warnings before CPAN release
